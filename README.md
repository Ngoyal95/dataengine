Record stock options data live from the markets and be able to replay it later


## Install
I recommend running with a virtualenv, which you can create by running:
`python3 -m pip venv env`
Then activate the venv:
`source venv/bin/activate` 
Install dependencies: 
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
The first thing you'll want to do is make sure you have executable privelleges. Confirm by running:
`chmod +x console.py` 
Then, run it:
`./console.py` or `python3 console.py`

You'll be greeted with a shell prompt `console >`. Type help for a list of commands
